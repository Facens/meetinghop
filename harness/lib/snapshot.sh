# Application Support directory, and MeetingHop's real defaults domain.
#
# THIS FILE IS APP-SPECIFIC (harness/SHARED.sha256, harness/README.md's
# "Shared files" section, excludes it by name alongside appfresh.sh): the
# domain name it defaults to is dev.facens.meetinghop. AgentMenu's own copy
# carries the same shape with dev.facens.agentmenu, plus a fourth root
# (~/.config/agentmenu) this file deliberately drops — see "What is checked
# here, and what AgentMenu's checks that this does not" below.
#
# Sourced, never executed, by harness/lib/appfresh.sh.
#
# ===== What gets hashed =====
#
#   claude       $HARNESS_SNAPSHOT_HOME/.claude*  (files and directories —
#                wider than "directories": ~/.claude.json sits right next to
#                ~/.claude/ and is exactly the kind of file a misrouted
#                override would touch)
#   appsupport   $HARNESS_SNAPSHOT_HOME/Library/Application Support/<domain>
#                the app's own real harness directory, Journal.
#                defaultDirectory's target and the one place
#                -MeetingHopHarnessDir exists specifically to relocate away
#                from — a broken override surfaces here first, which is why
#                this root is not a bonus the way it was in AgentMenu's own
#                header but the primary file check for this app.
#   domain       the live `defaults export <domain> -` reading
#
# ===== What is checked here, and what AgentMenu's checks that this does
# not =====
#
# AgentMenu also hashes a config/manifests root
# ($HARNESS_SNAPSHOT_HOME/.config/agentmenu) — MeetingHop has no such thing.
# It has no config file, no manifests overlay and no profile root of its
# own: everything it persists goes through UserDefaults or the harness
# journal directory above, both already covered. That root is dropped, not
# overlooked.
#
# `claude` is kept even though this app has no known route to
# $HOME/.claude* the way a profile-root override elsewhere in this harness
# might: R3's own wording names the Claude Code directories explicitly, and
# dropping a root R3 names by wording — rather than by this app's own
# behaviour — is exactly the quiet weakening this unit's brief warns
# against. It is also, by a wide margin, the most expensive root to hash on
# a real machine (~62,300 files measured by hand on this Mac for
# AgentMenu's own copy of this file, 2026-09-18) — see "batched, not
# per-file" below for why that is a cost this file pays anyway.
#
# NOT hashed, on purpose: $HOME/Library/Calendars, the CalendarAgent store
# MeetingHop reads through EventKit. It is the one thing this app reads
# every run, but it is also rewritten by macOS's own CalendarAgent on its
# own sync schedule — a subscribed calendar refreshing, a reminder's
# completion state changing, an iCloud sync landing — none of it caused by
# MeetingHop and none of it something this app could avoid touching by
# being correct. Hashing it would fail most runs for reasons R3 was never
# meant to catch, which trains a reader to expect
# watchdog-appfresh-snapshot.fired to be noise and stop reading it — the
# exact failure mode the batched-hashing decision below exists to prevent,
# just from the opposite direction. MeetingHop only ever reads this store
# (CalendarSource, via EKEventStore); R3 is about writes, and this file's
# own domain/appsupport/claude checks already cover every place this app
# could write one.
#
# ===== The defaults domain, read stably =====
#
# `defaults export <domain> -` is the one stable read here: it is answered by
# cfprefsd from its live, in-memory state, not from the on-disk plist, which
# cfprefsd flushes on its own schedule. Verified by hand against a scratch
# domain on this Mac (AgentMenu's own copy of this file, 2026-09-18): a
# `defaults write` was visible to `defaults read`/`export` immediately,
# before and after the on-disk file had a chance to reflect it, and two
# `defaults export -` calls back to back on an unmodified domain hashed
# identically — CFPropertyList's XML serialization is deterministic, not
# just typically stable. `defaults delete <domain>` was also confirmed to
# clear the keys but leave an empty plist file behind
# (harness/lib/appfresh.sh's teardown removes it directly). The on-disk
# plist's own size/mtime is therefore never part of the compared snapshot —
# a lazy flush of unchanged content would otherwise fail a clean run for no
# real reason.
#
# So: one "does this count as changed" decision, two different answers,
# both stated above rather than left for a reader to notice only in the
# code. A file's mtime only ever moves on a real write(2)/utimes(2), so it
# is compared; cfprefsd's own on-disk flush timing is unrelated to whether
# a write was accepted, so the plist's mtime is not.

# A file, a directory walked recursively, or nothing at all when `root`
# does not exist — a missing root is a valid state (a maintainer who has
# never run MeetingHop with the journal hook on has no harness directory
# yet), not a harness error.
#
# The directory case is batched: `find … -exec CMD {} +` hands each command
# as many paths as fit on one command line and repeats only as many times
# as ARG_MAX forces, instead of forking stat/stat/shasum/awk once per file.
# Measured by hand against this Mac's real ~/.claude and ~/.claude-personal
# (AgentMenu's own copy of this file, 2026-09-18, ~62,300 files, this
# unit's own "claude" root): a one-process-per-file loop did not finish
# inside appfresh.sh's 120-second teardown bound at all; the batched
# metadata pass took about 5 seconds and the batched content-hash pass
# about 45, a full snapshot_take around 25s warm end to end. That gap — not
# tidiness — is why this is two `find -exec` pipelines instead of one
# `find | while read` loop.
#
# Fast enough is not the same as quiet: this Mac's ~/.claude-personal is
# where Claude Code itself is writing project and tool-result files as it
# runs, so a scenario driven by Claude Code can genuinely change that tree
# during the run's own before/after window, with the app never at fault.
# This file guesses nothing: a wrong guess about which subpaths are "safe"
# is exactly the kind of hole R3 exists to close, so by default that case
# still compares as changed, appfresh_teardown still writes
# watchdog-appfresh-snapshot.fired, and the run still reports
# harness_error. The diff is what tells the two apart.
#
# HARNESS_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDE exists for the one case where the maintainer
# knows better: a colon-separated list of shell glob patterns, empty by
# default, matched against each absolute path. Nothing is dropped quietly —
# every pattern is written into the snapshot as an `excluded` line, so the
# manifest itself records which part of R3 was not checked and a report
# built from it can say so. Exclude the narrowest path that covers the
# churn, never a whole root: `~/.claude-personal` is a profile directory
# Claude Code may legitimately write to while driving a run, and excluding
# it would hide exactly the escape this check exists to catch.
# Whether a path is one the maintainer told this run not to check. Patterns
# are globs, so a trailing /* covers a subtree and a bare path covers one
