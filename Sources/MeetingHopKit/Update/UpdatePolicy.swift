/// The rules about *whether* and *what* this build may update to (R12, R20,
/// KTD20). Byte-for-byte the same reasoning as AgentMenuKit's copy, and
/// deliberately a copy rather than a shared package: the two apps share no
/// code, and a rule this small is cheaper to keep in step by reading than to
/// couple two repositories over. Sparkle itself lives in the app target —
/// this is the part the test runner can reach, since `MeetingHopKit` is
/// linked into the tests and the app is not.
///
/// Three decisions live here, each of which has a wrong answer that is
/// invisible until a release goes out:
///
/// - An alpha build must not update itself. A local `make bundle` is replaced
///   by the next `make bundle`; an updater compiled into it would swap the
///   maintainer's working build for the latest public release, which is the
///   opposite of what a local build is for.
/// - A build whose public key is empty must not check at all. Sparkle can
///   accept an update on a matching code signature alone, so a feed fetched
///   without a key to verify against is not merely unverified — it is a
///   second, weaker acceptance path nobody chose.
/// - A beta build looks at the beta channel by default, and a stable build
///   does not. Sparkle keeps no channel preference of its own (KTD8), so the
///   default is derived from the running version rather than mirrored into
///   storage. MeetingHop keeps the user's own answer in `SettingsStore`,
///   where AgentMenu keeps it in `config.toml` — the same tri-state either
///   way: unset until they say.
