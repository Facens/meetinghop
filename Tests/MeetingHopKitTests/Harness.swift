/// XCTest and swift-testing are Xcode-only tooling — neither module is present

/// suite cannot be a SwiftPM `.testTarget`. This is that replacement: an
/// executable that runs every suite and exits non-zero on the first failure it
/// records. It is deliberately small; it is not a test framework.
///
/// Ported from AgentMenu's `Tests/AgentMenuKitTests/Harness.swift`. One
/// addition beyond the source: per-suite expectation counts (`perSuite`,
/// `suiteOrder`), routed through a single `pass()` so every success path
/// increments both the total and the suite tally in one place — a suite that
/// silently stops running (an early `return`, a suite call that never
/// happens) shows up as a missing or short line in `report()` rather than
/// only a smaller grand total.
